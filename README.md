# Sketch Wanderer

A small SketchApp extension that introduce frictionless `Finder` like navigation in layer list by using beloved arrow keys and simple shortcuts. No more `shift`/`shift-tab` nightmare! 

> Huge thanks to [Sasha Okunev](https://twitter.com/okunev) who inspired me to build this plugin! :)

## Usage

Wanderer is very simple to use, just recall how navigation works in Finder and use any arrow keys with `control-option` modifiers.


## The complete list of supported commands:
| Command     | Shortcut | Description |
| :------- | :---- | :---- |
| Move Up | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> | Selects layer above |
| Move Down | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd> | Selects layer below |
| Expand Group    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>   | Expands selected group, shape group or artboard |
| Collapse Group    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>   | Collapses selected group, shape group or artboard. When run on already collapsed group, it's parent will be collapsed. |
| Select Up | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> | Finder like multi-select by holding shift and selecting files via arrows |
| Select Down    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>↓</kbd>   | Finder like multi-select by holding shift and selecting files via arrows |
| Expand Artboard    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>   | Expands all child groups in the current artboard. |
| Collapse Artboard    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>   | Collapses all child groups in the current artboard and artboard itself.  |
| Select Artboard Above    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>   | Selects artboard above current arboard. In case some child layer is selected, this command will select artboard itself.  |
| Select Artboard Below    | <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>   | Selects artboard below current artboard. |


## Simple Shortcuts Schema & Mission Control

By default Wanderer uses `control-option+arrows` shortcuts for the most common commands like `Move Up`, `Move Down` and `Expand/Collapse Group`:

It's quite nice, but not perfect - the better solution is to use shorter set `control+arrows`, which is by default occupied by `macOS: Mission Control`. Just in case you don't use these shortcuts, you could quickly replace them by using a special command by doing these simple steps:

1. Open `System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Mission Control` and disable the following highlighted system shortcuts:

2. In Sketch select `Plugins -> Wanderer -> Shortcuts Schema -> control+arrows` command:

3. Wait 10-15 seconds while Sketch reloading changes and check whether new shortcuts are setup correctly:

> Note: In case you'll need to revert changes, just run `Plugins -> Wanderer -> Shortcuts Schema -> control-option+arrows` command.
